      title: "How to Analyze Stocks Before Investing in Nepal",
      content: `Investing in the Nepalese stock market requires careful analysis. Start by examining the company's financial statements, including balance sheets, income statements, and cash flow statements. Look for consistent revenue growth, manageable debt levels, and strong profit margins.

Next, research the company's management team and their track record. Consider the industry outlook and how the company compares to its competitors in sectors like banking, insurance, or hydropower.

Finally, analyze valuation metrics like P/E ratio, book value, and dividend yield. Remember that NEPSE can be volatile, so always invest with a long-term perspective and proper risk management.`,

      title: "Understanding NEPSE Index: A Beginner's Guide",
      content: `The Nepal Stock Exchange (NEPSE) index is the benchmark indicator of the Nepalese stock market. It tracks the performance of all listed companies, with heavier weighting given to larger companies.

The index is calculated using a base year (currently 1994) with a base value of 100. When NEPSE rises, it means the majority of stocks are increasing in value. The index is affected by economic factors like interest rates, political stability, and foreign investment policies.

Key things to know:
- Trading hours are 11 AM to 3 PM Sunday-Thursday
- Settlement takes T+2 days
- There are over 200 listed companies across 13 sectors
- The index hit its all-time high of 3,198 in August 2021`,
